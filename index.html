      <h2>My Love Letter to You 💌</h2>
      <p>
        Hadija, from the moment you walked into my life, everything changed — quietly, deeply, beautifully. 
        You didn’t just become someone I love… you became my peace, my happiness, my home.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are days I look at you and wonder how I got so lucky. Your smile calms my storms. Your voice 
        feels like warmth. Your heart feels like the safest place I’ve ever known.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don’t promise perfection — but I promise effort. I promise loyalty. I promise choosing you, every day, 
        in every season, in every version of life.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are not just my love — you are my forever.

        Hadija, if love had a face, it would look like you.  
        If happiness had a voice, it would sound like you.  
        If my future had a name, it would be yours.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you for being my heart, my peace, my person.
